# ZBW Press Archives - Scripts and Templates

Scripts and templates for creating and maintaining the 20th Century Press
Archives web site https://pm20.zbw.eu . Almost all scripts work on a RDF/Turtle
file representation of the PM20 data. That file was created using the IFIS
database, stored within ZBW network, which is not accessed directly.
